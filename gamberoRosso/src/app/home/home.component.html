                Exquisite materials paired with industrial design elements the dining room looks basic and extremely
                cosy at the same time. We added our brands shade of "rosso" in a subtile manner, not to overwhelm but

                component of our ambience.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>business meetings</li>
                <li>candle-light dinner for two</li>
                <li>cerimonies like weddings or birthdays</li>

    <h1>Why choose us</h1>
    <p class="text-center">There are many restaurants out there, what makes us unique?</p>

        <li class="col-3">
            <h5>Unite gourmet approach with tradition</h5>
            <p>Our plates are not a clean and formal arrangement of foods, nor an overloaded, well intended portion by
                an italian granny. We only use high quality ingredients produced in the region by people we know, trying
                to conserve their original taste throughout the cooking process and not forgetting about the little
                "secrets" of traditional italian cuisine.</p>
        </li>

        <li class="col-3">
            <h5>Unique atmosphere</h5>
            <p>We position ourselves in the middle of androgyn style, freezing gourmet temples and crowded, popular
                restaurants. Our wish is to create a cosy atmosphere without overstepping the limits of other customers
                well-being.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="col-3">
            <h5>We lend an ear to customers with special needs</h5>
            <p>Why should our cuisine be restricted to some people? Do you need a gluten-free menu or are you suffering
                from other food-allergies like tree nuts, cow's milk or wheat. Just let us know, we can manage that!</p>
